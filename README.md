iput_wrapper
========

Wrapper for uploading files using iput for iRODS 4.X.X clients.
             
Handles logging, checksum/size checking, iput 'large file retries', wildcards,
deep directory creation, skipping existing files (when checksums and sizes match),
skipping existing directories, etc.                                           
                                                                              
The purpose is to:                                                            

1. Imitate irsync, which is buggy and missing most of the features of iput   
2. Create detailed log entries of transfers (creation of directories,        
   individual file transfer errors, checksum comparisons)                    
3. Force users to use best practices when tranferring files (avoid using     
   recursive transfers, compare checksums, etc.)                             
4. Help in transferring large directories                                    
5. Provide iRODS operators better logging for debugging user file            
   transfers assuming users remember/are able to use the wrappper and        
   are able to provide the transfer logs
